# Let's see the data types in action

# a = 24 #int
# b = 16 #int
# c = 5.5 #float

# Let's check the boolean values

# print(a>b) #True
# print(a<b) #False

# Let's look at some built in methods for boolean
greetings = 'Hello world!'
# isalpha() helps us check if the variable holding letters

print(greetings.isalpha())

# islower() checks if the statment is in lower case
print(greetings.islower())

# endswith() checks if the statment ends in the given
print(greetings.endswith('!'))

# startswith() checks if the statment starts with the given
print(greetings.startswith("H"))
# in SQL we have seen Null but in python we have none which is a key word in python
